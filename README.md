# TEST INVADERS proj

playable build: https://ostrilchuk.itch.io/test-invaders

Definition Of Done:
- state machine (atleast 4 states) 
- object pooling
- event driven UI 
- external input files (statistics for enemies loaded from external files, additional level configs) 

Simplified enemies behavior - left / right movement, shooting. 
Three types of enemies differing in appearance and statistics (shot frequency, dmg, reload time). 
Levels can be randomized, the appearance of the board, ship, enemies does not matter, without save / load. 
ETA - 1 week.
